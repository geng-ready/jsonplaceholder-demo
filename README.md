# JSONPlaceholder Demo

This project serves as a front-end engineering programming exercise. It is a React application that fetches and displays posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. The typical task for an interviewee would be to understand the existing codebase, and then implement new features or fix bugs based on specific instructions provided during the interview. It allows users to browse a list of posts, view individual post details, and navigate through posts using pagination.

## Purpose of this Project

This repository is designed to be used as a take-home exercise or live coding challenge for front-end engineering interviews.

**What to Expect:**

*   **Familiarization:** You'll start by cloning the repository and getting the application running locally. Take some time to understand the project structure, the existing components, and how data flows through the application.
*   **Task Implementation:** You will be given a specific task, which might involve:
    *   Implementing new features (e.g., adding a search/filter functionality, allowing post creation/deletion, displaying user comments).
    *   Fixing existing bugs (if any are intentionally introduced or discovered).
    *   Refactoring parts of the codebase for better performance, readability, or maintainability.
*   **Explanation:** Be prepared to discuss your approach, design choices, and any trade-offs you made while completing the task.

The primary goal is to assess your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of React and front-end development best practices within the context of an existing codebase.

## Features

*   View a list of posts.
*   View the details of a selected post.
*   Paginate through the list of posts.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Create React App:** A comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.
*   **JSONPlaceholder API:** A free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

*Note for Interviewees: The initial step is to get the project running and familiarize yourself with the codebase. Subsequent tasks will involve modifying or adding to this base project as per the interview instructions.*

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/jsonplaceholder-demo.git
    ```
    *Replace `your_username/jsonplaceholder-demo.git` with the actual URL of the repository.*
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd jsonplaceholder-demo
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Contributing

*For Interviewees: While this project is primarily an exercise, the following contribution guidelines (forking, creating a branch, making changes, and submitting a pull request if applicable to your interview process) outline a standard development workflow you might use to present your work.*

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

1.  Fork the Project
2.  Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3.  Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4.  Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5.  Open a Pull Request
